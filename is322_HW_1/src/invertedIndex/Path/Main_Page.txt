The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is a 2000 action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. It makes use of enhanced 3D graphics and features several gameplay changes, but reuses elements and character models from Ocarina of Time (1998). It follows Link, who arrives in a parallel world, Termina, and becomes embroiled in a quest to prevent the moon from crashing in three days' time. The game introduces gameplay concepts revolving around a perpetually repeating three-day cycle and the use of various masks that transform Link into different forms, and requires the Expansion Pak add-on for the Nintendo 64, which provides additional memory for more refined graphics. Majora's Mask was acclaimed by critics, and generated a cult following. It was rereleased for the GameCube in 2003, and for the online services of the Wii, Wii U, and Nintendo Switch. An enhanced remake for the Nintendo 3DS was released in 2015. (Full article...)

Selection on the ramp at Auschwitz II–Birkenau from the Auschwitz Album, a photographic record of the Holocaust during World War II. It and the Sonderkommando photographs are among the small number of visual documents that show the operations of Auschwitz II–Birkenau, the German extermination camp in occupied Poland. Originally titled "Resettlement of the Jews from Hungary" (Umsiedlung der Juden aus Ungarn), it shows a period when the Nazis accelerated their deportation of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz. The images were taken by photographers from the camp's Erkennungsdienst ("identification service"). Among other things, the Erkennungsdienst was responsible for fingerprinting and taking photo IDs of prisoners who had not been selected for extermination. The identity of the photographers is uncertain, but it is thought to have been Bernhard Walter or Ernst Hoffmann, two SS men who were director and deputy director of the Erkennungsdienst. The camp's director, Rudolf Höss, also may have taken several of the photographs himself.
