Lemurs of Madagascar is a 2010 reference work and field guide on the lemurs of Madagascar, giving descriptions and biogeographic data for the known species. The primary contributor is Russell Mittermeier, president of Conservation International, and the cover art and illustrations are by Stephen D. Nash. Currently in its third edition, the book provides details about all known lemur species, general information about lemurs and their history, and tips for identifying species. Four related pocket field guides have also been released, containing color illustrations of each species, miniature range maps, and species checklists. The first edition was reviewed favorably. The first edition identified 50 lemur species and subspecies, increased to 71 in the second edition and 101 in the third. The taxonomy promoted by these books has been questioned by researchers, such as Ian Tattersall, who view these growing numbers of lemur species as insufficiently justified inflation of species numbers.

In Ukraine's eastern Donetsk Oblast, there are 52 populated places officially granted city status by the Verkhovna Rada, the country's parliament. Settlements with more than 10,000 people are eligible to become cities although the status is also typically given by parliament to settlements of historical or regional importance. According to the country's last official census in 2001, the most populous city in the oblast was the regional capital Donetsk (pictured), with a population of 1,016,194 people, while the least populous city was Sviatohirsk, with 5,136 people. Following fighting during the Donbas war, 21 of the oblast's cities were occupied by pro-Russian separatists. After the enactment of decommunization laws across the country, ten cities in both Ukrainian-controlled and separatist-occupied territory were given new names in 2016 which were unrecognized by de facto pro-Russian officials in the occupied cities.

The red-chested cuckoo (Cuculus solitarius) is a species of cuckoo. It is a medium-sized bird, about 31 cm (12.2 in) in length, found in Sub-Saharan Africa. The male has slate-grey upper parts, pale grey throat and sides of head and dark grey tail tipped with white. The breast is rufous or cinnamon, often with barring, and the belly is creamy-white or pale buff. The female is similar but the colour of the breast is duller and with variable amounts of barring. It is usually solitary and highly vocal and lives on forests and plantations. It eats insects including caterpillars, spiders, centipedes, millipedes, slugs, snails, small vertebrates and berries. This red-chested cuckoo was photographed in Kibale National Park, Kenya.
