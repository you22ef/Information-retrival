The initial campaign of the Breton Civil War took place in 1341. John, Duke of Brittany, had died on 30 April 1341 and the Duchy of Brittany was claimed by both his younger half-brother, John of Montfort; and his niece's husband, Charles of Blois, a nephew of the king of France, Philip VI. John quickly installed friendly garrisons in most of the towns and castles of Brittany. Rumours of John's discussions with English emissaries reached Philip, causing him to recognise Charles as the new duke. John refused to give way and Philip sent an army to Brittany to impose Charles. Within a month John had been defeated and was a prisoner. His wife, Joanna, took command of her husband's army, stormed the town of Redon and moved to the small but strongly walled port of Hennebont. There she set up her two-year-old son, also named John, as the faction's figurehead. The Hundred Years' War between France and England had been ongoing since 1337, so she despatched a senior counsellor to encourage English military intervention. (Full article...)

Mimetite is a lead arsenate chloride mineral ( Pb5(AsO4)3Cl) which forms as a secondary mineral in lead deposits, usually by the oxidation of galena and arsenopyrite. The name derives from the Greek Μιμητής (mimetes), meaning "imitator," and refers to mimetite's resemblance to the similar mineral pyromorphite. This focus-stacked photograph shows a 3 cm × 1.7 cm × 1 cm (1.18 in × 0.67 in × 0.39 in) sample of mimetite collected from the Congreso-León mines in the Mexican state of Chihuahua.
