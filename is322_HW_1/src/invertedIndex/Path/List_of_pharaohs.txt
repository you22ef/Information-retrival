However, the specific title was not used to address the kings of Egypt by their contemporaries until the New Kingdom's 18th Dynasty, c. 1400 BC. Along with the title pharaoh for later rulers, there was an Ancient Egyptian royal titulary used by Egyptian kings which remained relatively constant during the course of Ancient Egyptian history, initially featuring a Horus name, a Sedge and Bee (nswt-bjtj) name and a Two Ladies (nbtj) name, with the additional Golden Horus, nomen and prenomen titles being added successively during later dynasties. Egypt was continually governed, at least in part, by native pharaohs for approximately 2500 years, until it was conquered by the Kingdom of Kush in the late 8th century BC, whose rulers adopted the traditional pharaonic titulature for themselves. Following the Kushite conquest, Egypt experienced another period of independent native rule before being conquered by the Achaemenid Empire, whose rulers also adopted the title of pharaoh. The last native pharaoh of Egypt was Nectanebo II, who was pharaoh before the Achaemenids conquered Egypt for a second time. Achaemenid rule over Egypt came to an end through the conquests of Alexander the Great in 332 BC, after which it was ruled by Hellenic Pharaohs of the Ptolemaic Dynasty. Their rule, and the independence of Egypt, came to an end when Egypt became a province of Rome in 30 BC. Augustus and subsequent Roman emperors were styled as Pharaoh when in Egypt until the reign of Maximinus Daza in 314 AD. The dates given in this list of pharaohs are approximate. They are based primarily on the conventional chronology of Ancient Egypt, mostly based on the Digital Egypt for Universities[4] database developed by the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, but alternative dates taken from other authorities may be indicated separately. Ancient Egyptian king lists [edit] Modern lists of pharaohs are based on historical records and, including Ancient Egyptian king lists and later histories, such as Manetho's Aegyptiaca, as well as archaeological evidence. Concerning ancient sources, Egyptologists and historians alike call for caution in regard to the credibility, exactitude and completeness of these sources, many of which were written long after the reigns they report.[5] An additional problem is that ancient king lists are often damaged, inconsistent with one another and/or selective. The following ancient king lists are known (along with the dynasty under which they were created):[6] Den seal impressions (1st Dynasty); found on a cylinder seal in Den's tomb. It lists all 1st Dynasty kings from Narmer to Den by their Horus names.[7] Palermo Stone (5th Dynasty); carved on an olivine-basalt slab. Broken into pieces and thus today incomplete. Giza writing board (6th Dynasty); painted with red, green and black ink on gypsum and cedar wood. Very selective. South Saqqara Stone (6th Dynasty); carved on a black basalt slab. Very selective. Karnak King List (18th Dynasty); carved on limestone. Very selective. Abydos King List of Seti I (19th Dynasty); carved on limestone. Very detailed, but omitting some of the Kings from First Intermediate Period and all the kings from Second Intermediate Period of Egypt. Abydos King List of Ramesses II (19th Dynasty); carved on limestone. Very selective, today damaged. Ramesseum king list (19th Dynasty); carved on limestone. Contains most of the New Kingdom pharaohs up to Ramesses II. Saqqara Tablet (19th Dynasty), carved on limestone. Very detailed, but omitting most kings of the 1st Dynasty for unknown reasons. Turin King List (19th Dynasty); written with red and black ink on papyrus. Likely the most complete king-list in history, today damaged. Medinet Habu king list (20th Dynasty); carved on limestone and very similar to the Ramesseum king list. Genealogy of Ankhefensekhmet (22nd Dynasty); carved on limestone, today damaged. Manetho's Aegyptiaca (Greek Period); possibly written on papyrus. The original writings are lost today and many anecdotes assigned to certain kings seem fictitious. Predynastic Period [edit] Main article: Prehistoric Egypt The Predynastic Period ends c. 3100 BC when Egypt was first unified as a single kingdom. Lower Egypt [edit] Main article: Lower Egypt Lower Egypt geographically consists of the northern Nile and the Nile delta. The following list may be incomplete: Image Name Comments Reign [...]pu[8] Only known from the Palermo stone[9] Unknown Hsekiu / Seka Only known from the Palermo stone[9] Unknown Khayu Only known from the Palermo stone[10] Unknown Tiu / Teyew Only known from the Palermo stone[11] Unknown Thesh / Tjesh Only known from the Palermo stone[12] Unknown Neheb Only known from the Palermo stone[13] Unknown Wazner Only known from the Palermo stone[14] c. 3290 BC Mekh Only known from the Palermo stone[15] Unknown [...]a[16] Only known from the Palermo stone[15] Unknown Hedju Hor Only known from two clay jugs from Tura, Egypt Naqada II c. 3250 BC Ny-Hor Only known from clay and stone vessels found in tombs near Tarchan, Tura, Tarjan, and Nagada. Some scholars believe that this serekh is simply a crude attempt at writing the name "Narmer".[17] Naqada II c. 3240 BC Ni-Neith Only known from inscriptions in Helwan. Reading of name is uncertain.[18] c. 3230 BC Hat-Hor Some scholars believe that this serekh is simply a crude attempt at writing the name "Narmer".[19] c. 3220 BC [Double Falcon] May also have ruled in Upper Egypt c. 3210 BC Wash Only known from the Narmer Palette[20] c. 3150 BC Upper Egypt [edit] Main article: Naqada III Upper Egypt refers to the region up-river to the south of Lower Egypt. Regrouped here are predynastic rulers of Upper Egypt belonging to the late Naqada III period, sometimes informally described as Dynasty 0: Image Name Comments Reign A (?) Only known from a graffito discovered in the Western Desert in 2004.[21] This ruler is otherwise unattested. c. 3180 BC [Finger Snail] The existence of this king is very doubtful.[22] Naqada III — [Fish][23] Only known from artifacts that bear his mark. He most likely never existed.[22] Naqada III [Elephant][24] More than likely never existed Naqada III [Stork][25][26] [22] Naqada III [Bull] [22] c. 3280 BC Naqada III [Scorpion I] c. 3255 BC Predynastic rulers: Dynasty 0 [edit] Main article: Dynasty 0 Since these kings precede the First Dynasty, they have been informally grouped as "Dynasty 0".[clarification needed] The following list of predynastic rulers may be incomplete: Image Name Comments Reign [Crocodile] Potentially read Shendjw; identity and existence are disputed.[27] c. 3170 BC Iry-Hor Correct chronological position unclear.[28] c. 3170 BC Ka Maybe read Sekhen rather than Ka. Correct chronological position unclear.[29] c. 3170 BC [Scorpion II] Potentially read Serqet; possibly the same person as Narmer.[30] c. 3170 BC Early Dynastic Period [edit] Main article: Early Dynastic Period of Egypt The Early Dynastic Period of Egypt stretches from c. 3100 to 2686 BC.[31] First Dynasty [edit] Main article: First Dynasty of Egypt The First Dynasty ruled from c. 3100 to c. 2890 BC.[32] Image Name Personal name Comments Reign Narmer Menes? Believed by many scholars to be the same person as Menes, due to the preponderance of evidence indicating this.[33] His name is widely attested across Egypt, and has also been found at Nahal Tillah in Israel, which is much farther afield than his predecessors.[34] c. 3150 BC[32] Hor-Aha Teti Greek form: Athotís.[35] May also be Menes although Narmer is more likely.[33] Trade was largely replaced by direct exploitation of resources via outposts during his reign.[36] Possibly the son of Narmer. c. 3050 BC Djer[37] Iti Greek form: Kénkenes. His tomb was later thought to be the legendary tomb of Osiris. First pharaoh with a full Golden Horus name. Interest and trade with Egypt's North Eastern borders appears to have been renewed during Djer's reign.[36] 41 years, c. 3000 BC[38] Djet[39] Ita Greek form: Ouenephes. Indications show that Djet did not reign for long.[40] 10 years, c. 2980 BC[41] Merneith — Possibly the first female pharaoh of Egypt. She may have ruled as regent for her son Den. Her tomb is notable for being on the same scale as other tombs of other kings of that period. c. 2950 BC Den[42] Sepati Greek form: Ousaphaidos. Den was the first pharaoh to have a Nesut-biti (dual king) name, and is the first pharaoh attested wearing the double crown (pschent) of upper and lower Egypt.[43] A second sed festival is attested from his reign, indicating he enjoyed a long time in power.[43] Den focused on the northeastern part of Egypt during his reign, and also led a few small battles in the northeast which are attested on the Palermo stone.[44] c. 2965 - c. 2923 BC[45] Adjib Merybiap Greek form: Miebidós.[46] Known for his ominous nebwy-title.[47] 9 years, c. 2930 BC Semerkhet Semsu Greek form: Semempsés.[48] First Egyptian ruler with a fully developed Nebty name. His complete reign is preserved on the Cairo Stone. Many stone vessels of his predecessor were found reinscribed for Semerkhet so he may have been a usurper.[49] 8.5 years, c. 2920 BC[41] Qa'a Qebeh Greek form: Bienékhes.[50] Ruled very long, his tomb is the last one with subsidiary tombs. 34 years, c. 2916 BC Sneferka – Very short reign, correct chronological position unknown. c. 2900 BC [Horus Bird] – Very short reign, correct chronological position unknown. c. 2900 BC Second Dynasty [edit] Main article: Second Dynasty of Egypt The Second Dynasty ruled from c. 2890 to 2686 BC.[32] Image Throne name Personal name Comments Reign Hotepsekhemwy[51] Bedjatau Manetho names him Boëthos and reports that under this ruler an earthquake killed many people. Hotepsekhemwy broke the tradition of being buried at the Abydos royal cemetery at Umm-el-Qa'ab, where most of the 1st dynasty kings are buried, and chose to be buried at Saqqara instead to be closer to the capital.[52] 27 years, c. 2890 BC Nebra[53] Kakau Greek form: Kaíechós (after the Ramesside cartouche name Kakaw). First ruler who uses the sun-symbol in his royal name, could be identical to king Weneg. 12 years, c. 2850 BC Nynetjer[54] Banetjer Greek form: Binóthris. May have divided Egypt between his successors, allegedly allowed women to rule like pharaohs. c. 2775 - c. 2730 BC Ba – May have been an independent ruler succeeding Nynetjer. Alternatively, he may have ruled in the 1st or 3rd dynasties or be the same person as Horus Bird. Unknown Weneg-Nebty[55] – Greek form: Ougotlas / Tlás. Could be an independent ruler succeeding Nynetjer or the same as Peribsen, Sekhemib-Perenmaat, or Raneb. c. 2740 BC Wadjenes Wadjenes Greek form: Tlas May have been a misinterpretation of the hieroglyphic sign of a flower called Weneg. May have been a crown prince or be the same person as Weneg-Nebty. c. 2740 BC Nubnefer – May have been the birth name of Nebra. May either be the successor of Wadjenes or Nynetjer. Unknown Senedj[56] Greek form: Sethenes. Possibly the same person as Peribsen. This, however, is highly disputed.[57] 47 years (supposedly) Seth-Peribsen Peribsen Used a Seth-animal above his serekh rather than a Horus falcon. He promoted the sun-cult in Egypt and reduced the powers of officials, nomarchs and palatines. Some scholars believe that he ruled over a divided Egypt.[58] c. 2740 BC Sekhemib Sekhemib-Perenmaat Could be the same person as Seth-Peribsen.[59] c. 2720 BC Neferkara I Greek form: Néphercherés. Known only from Ramesside king lists, not archaeologically attested. c. 2740 BC Neferkasokar Greek form: Sesóchris. Known only from Ramesside king lists, not archaeologically attested. Old Kingdom legends claim that this ruler saved Egypt from a long-lasting drought.[60] 8 years, c. 2740 BC Horus Sa – May have been a short form of the Horus-name Sanakht. May have been the Horus-name of Weneg or Senedj, correct chronological position unclear. Unknown – ("Hudjefa") Known only from Ramesside king lists, his "name" is actually a paraphrase pointing out that the original name of the king was already lost in Ramesside times. 11 years (according to the Turin Canon) Khasekhemwy[52] Beb(e)ty Greek form: Chenerés. It is probable that when Khasekhem acceded kingship he was a ruler of upper Egypt, he led campaigns against lower Egypt that ended in his victory, to commemorate his achievement of reunifying Egypt he changed his name to Khasekhemwy.[52] His serekh name is unique for presenting both Horus and Set. He was one of Egypt's first master builders, his funerary enclosure known as Shunet-ez-Zebib is a colossal mudbrick structure.[61] c. 2704 - c. 2686 BC Old Kingdom [edit] Main article: Old Kingdom of Egypt The Old Kingdom of Egypt is the long period of stability and growth following the Early Dynastic Period and preceding the troubled First Intermediate Period. The kingdom spanned from 2686 to 2181 BC. Third Dynasty [edit] Main article: Third Dynasty of Egypt The Third Dynasty ruled from 2686 to 2613 BC.[32] Image Throne name Personal name Comments Reign Netjerikhet Djoser[62][63] Hellenized names Sesorthos and Tosórthros. Commissioned the first Pyramid in Egypt, created by chief architect and scribe Imhotep. c. 2670 - c. 2650 BC[64] Sekhemkhet[65] (Djoser-)Teti Greek form: Tyréis (after the Ramesside cartouche name for Sekhemkhet, Teti). In the necropolis of his unfinished step pyramid, the remains of a 2-year old infant were found.[66] c. 2650 - c. 2643 BC Sanakht Nebka? Likely to be identified with the throne name Nebka; Hellenized names Necherôchis and Necherôphes. May have reigned 6 years if identified with the penultimate king of the Dynasty on the Turin canon. c. 2650 BC Qahedjet – Possibly be the same person as Huni or an archaistic representation of Thutmose III, correct chronological position unknown. Unknown Khaba – Possibly built an unfinished step pyramid, could be identical with Huni. 2643–2637 BC Huni[67] Greek form: Áches. Could be the same as Qahedjet or Khaba. Possibly built an unfinished step pyramid and several cultic pyramids throughout Egypt. Huni was for a long time credited with the building of the pyramid of Meidum. This, however, is disproved by New Kingdom graffiti that praise king Sneferu, not Huni. 2637–2613 BC Fourth Dynasty [edit] Main article: Fourth Dynasty of Egypt The Fourth Dynasty ruled from 2613 to 2496 BC.[32] Image Throne name Personal name Comments Reign Nebmaat Sneferu Greek form: Sóris. Reigned 24 years, giving him enough time to build the Meidum Pyramid, the Bent Pyramid and the Red Pyramid. Some scholars believe that he was buried in the Red Pyramid. For a long time it was thought that the Meidum Pyramid was not Sneferu's work, but that of king Huni. Ancient Egyptian documents describe Sneferu as a pious, generous and even accostable ruler.[68] 2613–2589 BC[32] Medjedu (Khnum-) Khufu Greek form: Cheops and Suphis. Built the Great Pyramid of Giza. Khufu is depicted as a cruel tyrant by ancient Greek authors; Ancient Egyptian sources however describe him as a generous and pious ruler. He is the main protagonist in the Westcar Papyrus. The first imprinted papyri originate from Khufu's reign, which may have made ancient Greek authors believe that Khufu wrote books in attempt to praise the gods. 2589–2566 BC Kheper Djedefre Greek form: Rátoises. Some scholars believe he created the Great Sphinx of Giza as a monument for his deceased father. He also created a pyramid at Abu Rawash. However, this pyramid is no longer extant; it is believed the Romans re-purposed the materials from which it was made. 2566–2558 BC Userib Khafre Greek form: Chéphren and Suphis II. His pyramid is the second largest in Giza. Some scholars prefer him as the creator of the Great Sphinx before Djedefra. His funerary complex was the largest at the Giza plateau. 2558–2532 BC Baka/Bakare Greek form: Bikheris. Could be the owner of the Unfinished Northern Pyramid of Zawyet el'Aryan. Possibly fictional. c. 2570 BC Kakhet Menkaure Greek form: Menchéres. His pyramid is the third and smallest in Giza. A legend claims that his only daughter died due to an illness and Menkaura buried her in a golden coffin in the shape of a cow. 2532–2503 BC Shepeskhet Shepseskaf Greek form: Seberchéres. Owner of the Mastabat el-Fara'un. 2503–2498 BC – (Thamphthis) According to Manetho the last king of the 4th dynasty. He is not archaeologically attested and thus possibly fictional. c. 2500 BC Fifth Dynasty [edit] Main article: Fifth Dynasty of Egypt The Fifth Dynasty ruled from 2496 to 2345 BC.[32] Image Throne name Personal name Comments Reign Irimaat Userkaf Buried in a pyramid in Saqqara. Built the first solar temple at Abusir. 2496–2491 BC Sahure Moved the royal necropolis to Abusir, where he built his pyramid. 2490–2477 BC Neferirkare Kakai Son of Sahure, born with the name Ranefer 2477–2467 BC Neferefre Izi Son of Neferirkare 2460–2458 BC Shepseskare Netjeruser Reigned most likely after Neferefre and for only a few months, possibly a son of Sahure.[69] A few months Nyuserre Ini Brother to Neferefre, built extensively in the Abusir necropolis. 2445–2422 BC Menkauhor Ikau Last pharaoh to build a sun temple 2422–2414 BC Djedkare Isesi Effected comprehensive reforms of the Egyptian administration. Enjoyed the longest reign of his dynasty, with likely more than 35 years on the throne. 2414–2375 BC Unas The Pyramid of Unas is inscribed with the earliest instance of the pyramid texts. He also constructed Unas's causeway a 500m long causeway from the bank of the river Nile to his funerary complex, this is where his funerary precession would have taken place. 2375–2345 BC Sixth Dynasty [edit] Main article: Sixth Dynasty of Egypt The Sixth Dynasty ruled from 2345 to 2181 BC. Image Throne name Personal name Comments Reign — Teti According to Manetho, he was murdered. 2345–2333 BC Userkare Reigned one to five years, may have usurped the throne at the expense of Teti 2333–2332 BC Meryre Pepi I Faced conspiracies and political troubles yet became the most prolific builder of his dynasty 2332–2283 BC Merenre Nemtyemsaf I Reformed the administration of Upper Egypt by decentralization, received the submission of Lower Nubia 2283–2278 BC Neferkare Pepi II Possibly the longest-reigning monarch in human history, with 94 years on the throne. Alternatively, may have reigned only 64 years. 2278–2183 BC — Neferka Reigned during Pepi II; was possibly his son or co-ruler. Possibly writing mistake for "Neferkare" 2200–2199 BC Merenre Nemtyemsaf II[70] Short lived pharaoh, possibly an aged son of Pepi II. 1 year and 1 month c. 2183 BC Netjerkare I Neitiqerty Siptah (Nitocris) This male king gave rise to the legendary queen Nitocris of Herodotus and Manetho.[71] Sometimes classified as the first king of the combined 7th/8th Dynasties. Short reign: c. 2182–2179 BC First Intermediate Period [edit] Main article: First Intermediate Period of Egypt The First Intermediate Period (2183–2060 BC) is a period of disarray and chaos between the end of the Old Kingdom and the advent of the Middle Kingdom. The Old Kingdom rapidly collapsed after the death of Pepi II. He had reigned for more than 64 and likely up to 94 years, longer than any monarch in history. The latter years of his reign were marked by inefficiency because of his advanced age. The union of the Two Kingdoms fell apart and regional leaders had to cope with the resulting famine. The kings of the 7th and 8th Dynasties, who represented the successors of the 6th Dynasty, tried to hold onto some power in Memphis but owed much of it to powerful nomarchs. After 20 to 45 years, they were overthrown by a new line of pharaohs based in Herakleopolis Magna. Some time after these events, a rival line based at Thebes revolted against their nominal Northern overlords and united Upper Egypt. c. 2055 BC, Mentuhotep II, the son and successor of pharaoh Intef III defeated the Herakleopolitan pharaohs and reunited the Two Lands, thereby starting the Middle Kingdom. Seventh and Eighth Dynasties [edit] Main articles: Seventh Dynasty of Egypt and Eighth Dynasty of Egypt The Seventh and Eighth Dynasties ruled for approximately 20–45 years. They comprise numerous ephemeral kings reigning from Memphis over a possibly divided Egypt and, in any case, holding only limited power owing to the effectively feudal system into which the administration had evolved. The list below is based on the Abydos King List dating to the reign of Seti I and taken from Jürgen von Beckerath's Handbuch der ägyptischen Königsnamen[72] as well as from Kim Ryholt's latest reconstruction of the Turin canon, another king list dating to the Ramesside Era.[73] Image Throne name Personal name Comments Reign Khui — Attested to by a relief fragment with the cartouche of Khui from a mastaba in Dara.[74] Duration unknown, c. 2150 BC? Menkare — Likely attested by a relief fragment from the tomb of queen Neit.[75][76][77] Probably short, c. 2181 BC Neferkare II — — Unknown Neferkare III Neby Attested by inscriptions in the tomb of his mother Ankhesenpepi, started the construction of a pyramid in Saqqara. Unknown Djedkare Shemai – — Unknown Neferkare IV – — Unknown Merenhor — — Unknown Neferkamin I / Sneferka — Unknown Nikare — Possibly attested by a cylinder-seal. Unknown Neferkare V Tereru — Unknown Neferkahor — Attested by a cylinder seal. Unknown Neferkare VI Pepiseneb — Unknown to 2171 BC Neferkamin Anu – — c. 2170 BC Qakare Ibi Built a poorly constructed pyramid at Saqqara inscribed with the last known instance of the Pyramid Texts 2175–2171 BC Neferkaure — Attested by one to three decrees from the temple of Min at Coptos. 2167–2163 BC Neferkauhor Khuwihapi Attested by eight decrees from the temple of Min and an inscription in the tomb of Shemay. 2163–2161 BC Neferirkare Pepi Possibly to be identified with horus Demedjibtawy, in which case he is attested by a decree from the temple of Min. 2161–2160 BC Ninth Dynasty [edit] Main article: Ninth Dynasty of Egypt The Ninth Dynasty[78] ruled from 2160 to 2130 BC.[32] The Turin King List has 18 kings reigning in the Ninth and Tenth Dynasties. Of these, twelve names are missing and four are partial.[78] Image Name Comments Reign Meryibre Khety I (Acthoes I) Manetho states that Achthoes founded this dynasty. 2160 BC–unknown[32] — — Name lost — Unknown — Neferkare VII — — Unknown Nebkaure Khety II (Acthoes II) — Unknown — Senen[...] or Setut — Unknown — — Name lost — Unknown — Mery[...] — — Unknown — Shed[...] — — Unknown — H[...] — — Unknown — — Name lost — Unknown — — Name lost — Unknown — — Name lost — Unknown User(?)[...] — — Unknown Imhotep — Ephemeral ruler of the Ninth Dynasty.

Image Name Comments Reign Intef the Elder Theban nomarch (Iry-pat) serving an unnamed king, later considered a founding figure of the 11th Dynasty. Unknown The successors of Intef the Elder, starting with Mentuhotep I, became independent from their northern overlords and eventually conquered Egypt under Mentuhotep II. Image Throne name Personal name Comments Reign Tepia Mentuhotep I Nominally a Theban nomarch (Tepy-a) but may have ruled independently.

In addition to the Twelfth Dynasty, some scholars include the Eleventh, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Dynasties in the Middle Kingdom. The Middle Kingdom can be noted for the expansion of trade outside of the kingdom that occurred during this time. Eleventh Dynasty cont.

Image Throne name Personal name Comments Reign Sehetepibre Amenemhat I[90][91] (Ammanemes I)[92] Amenemhat I was not from a royal family, and built the first substantial pyramid since Pepi II at Lisht.[93] He restored order in Egypt, and then built a new capital called Itjtawy. Amenemhat I was probably assassinated.[94] 1991–1962 BC[32] Kheperkare Senusret I[95] (Sesonchosis)[96] Senusret I built extensively in upper Egypt, including the temple of Amun at Karnak.[93] Senusret I claimed to have sent 17,000 people into the Wadi Hammamat to bring back stone for 150 statues and 60 sphinxes.[97] He also constructed a pyramid at Lisht near his fathers pyramid. 1971–1926 BC Nubkaure Amenemhat II[98] (Ammenemes II)[99] Amenemhat II recorded his reign in now fragmented annals.[93] The Egyptian navy may have attacked Cyprus during his campaigns.[100] Amenemhat II also built a pyramid at Dashur. Ruled for at least 35 years. 1929–1895 BC[32] Khakheperre Senusret II[101] (No name given by Manetho)[102] Senusret II developed the Fayyum as a major agricultural resource during his reign.[103] He also built a pyramid at Lahun. 1897–1878 BC[32] Khakaure Senusret III[104] (Sesostris)[105] Senusret III got rid of nomarchs and made 3 administrative districts.[106] He also led campaigns into Lower Nubia in his 8th, 10th, 16th, and 18th regnal years.[100] Senusret III also built his own pyramid at Dashur and was the most powerful and influential pharaoh of the 12th dynasty. 1878–1839 BC Nimaatre Amenemhat III[107] (Lamares)[108] Amenemhat III further developed the Fayyum as an agricultural region.[93] He also constructed a large mortuary complex at Hawara including his pyramid, the mortuary complex was probably the labyrinth that inspired the ancient Greek authors.[109] 1860–1814 BC Maakherure Amenemhat IV[110] (Ammenemes)[111] Had a co-regency lasting at least 1 year based on an inscription at Konosso. 1816–1807 BC Sobekkare Sobekneferu[112] (Skemiophris)[113] The first known archeologically attested female Pharaoh. 1807–1802 BC The position of a possible additional ruler, Seankhibtawy Seankhibra, is uncertain. He may be an ephemeral king, or a name variant of a king of the 12th or 13th Dynasty. Second Intermediate Period [edit] Main article: Second Intermediate Period of Egypt The Second Intermediate Period (1802–1550 BC) is a period of disarray between the end of the Middle Kingdom, and the start of the New Kingdom. It is best known as when the Hyksos, whose reign comprised the Fifteenth Dynasty, made their appearance in Egypt. The Thirteenth Dynasty was much weaker than the Twelfth Dynasty, and was unable to hold onto the two lands of Egypt. Either at the start of the dynasty, c. 1805 BC or toward the middle of it in c. 1710 BC, the provincial ruling family in Xois, located in the marshes of the eastern Delta, broke away from the central authority to form the Canaanite Fourteenth Dynasty. The Hyksos made their first appearance during the reign of Sobekhotep IV, and c. 1720 BC took control of the town of Avaris (the modern Tell el-Dab'a/Khata'na), conquering the kingdom of the 14th dynasty. Sometime around 1650 BC the Hyksos, perhaps led by Salitis the founder of the Fifteenth Dynasty, conquered Memphis, thereby terminating the 13th dynasty. The power vacuum in Upper Egypt resulting from the collapse of the 13th dynasty allowed the 16th dynasty to declare its independence in Thebes, only to be overrun by the Hyksos kings shortly thereafter. Subsequently, as the Hyksos withdrew from Upper Egypt, the native Egyptian ruling house in Thebes set itself up as the Seventeenth Dynasty. This dynasty eventually drove the Hyksos back into Asia under Seqenenre Tao, Kamose and finally Ahmose, first pharaoh of the New Kingdom. Thirteenth Dynasty [edit] Main article: Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt The Thirteenth Dynasty (following the Turin King List) ruled from 1802 to c. 1649 BC and lasted 153 or 154 years according to Manetho.

Some of the contested rulers of the 14th Dynasty (proposed by Kim Ryholt) are commonly identified by Egyptologists as being of Canaanite (Semitic) descent, owing to the distinct origins of the names of some of their kings and princes. However, the dynasty rulers are not referred to as Hyksos in the Turin kings list.[118] It is here given according to Ryholt; however, this reconstruction of the dynasty is heavily debated with the position of the five kings preceding Nehesy highly disputed.

Through military dominance abroad, the New Kingdom saw Egypt's greatest territorial extent. It expanded far into Nubia in the south, and held wide territories in the Near East. Egyptian armies fought with Hittite armies for control of modern-day Syria. Three of the best known pharaohs of the New Kingdom are Akhenaten, also known as Amenhotep IV, whose exclusive worship of the Aten is often interpreted as the first instance of monotheism, Tutankhamun known for the discovery of his nearly intact tomb, and Ramesses II who attempted to recover the territories in modern Israel/Palestine, Lebanon and Syria that had been held in the Eighteenth Dynasty. His reconquest led to the Battle of Qadesh, where he led the Egyptian armies against the army of the Hittite king Muwatalli II.

His name change from Tutankhaten to Tutankhamun reflects the change in religion from the monolatristic Atenism to the classic religion, of which Amun is a major deity. He is thought to have taken the throne at around age eight or nine and to have died around age eighteen or nineteen, giving him the nickname "The Boy King." He became famous for being buried in a decorative tomb intended for someone else called KV62. 1332–1323 BC[149] Kheperkheperure Ay II Was Grand Vizier to Tutankhamun and an important official during the reigns of Akhenaten and Smenkhkare.

The most famous member of this dynasty was Cleopatra VII, in modern times known simply as Cleopatra, who was successively the consort of Julius Caesar and, after Caesar's death, of Mark Antony, having children with both of them. Cleopatra strove to create a dynastic and political union between Egypt and Rome, but the assassination of Caesar and the defeat of Mark Antony doomed her plans.[170] Caesarion (Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar) was the last king of the Ptolemaic Dynasty of Egypt, and he reigned jointly with his mother Cleopatra VII of Egypt, from September 2, 47 BC. He was the eldest son of Cleopatra VII, and possibly the only son of Julius Caesar, after whom he was named. Between the death of Cleopatra, on August 12, 30 BC, up to his own own death in late August 30 BC, he was nominally the sole pharaoh. Ultimately, he was killed on the orders of Octavian, who would become the Roman emperor Augustus.
